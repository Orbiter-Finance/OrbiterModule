## Project

- OrbitalModule has been deployed and will be open-source soon.
- A Docker project is written in js, deployed in the EC2 server, and has no external exposed port.
- It is always online and responds to the Senderâ€™s needs via RPC data. It is a tool provided to Navigator.

## Functional

- Running this project requires setting the necessary parameters, such as localProvider and localWSProvider, which support each rollup node.

- By configuring the parameters, the project can realize the economic and time savings that users can make by Orbiter when configuring the rollup dynamics. After the user initiates payment through the front-end wallet, it will monitor the transaction data of each rollup in real time and feedback the real-time status of the user's cross-rollup transfer in time.

## Design

**[backend](./backend)** - Navigator's auto script and Dashboard's api services.

**[frontend](./frontend)** - Dashboard's frontend. Based on Vue3 + Element Plus

## Project setup

### Change config

#### 1. Set backend/src/config/maker.ts

- Copy [backend/src/config/maker_backend.ts](./backend/src/config/maker_backup.ts) as maker.ts
- Replace the [Your Key] part with your key
- replace `makerAddress` value

#### 2. Set trade maker address and token address at this file

**[./backend/src/util/maker/maker_list.ts](./backend/src/util/maker/maker_list.ts)**

### Install docker and docker-compose

- [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Build docker image and run docker

#### Set backend's ORBITER_SCENE

- When you only maker service, set `ORBITER_SCENE=maker`
- When you only dashboard service, set `ORBITER_SCENE=dashboard`
- When you only all service, set `ORBITER_SCENE=all` (default)
- <font color="yellow"><b>Warning:</b></font> if you run maker service, please do not expose your ip or port on the public network

```
# When you need run at daemon, add -d
docker-compose up [-d]
```

#### And, when you run maker service, also need to set maker privateKey

```
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-type':'application/json' -d '{"privatekey":"your privatekey"}' http://localhost:[port(default:3002)]/maker/privatekey
```

#### Next, you also need to clear shell history

```
# Editor ~/.bash_history, clear shell's privatekey info
vim ~/.bash_history

# Clear cache
history -r
```

#### Also, you can run `privatekey_input.py` set privatekey

```
./privatekey_input.py
```

##### When you need it run in backend, use `screen`

```
screen -S privatekey_input
```

```
./privatekey_input.py
```

##### End do it and input keys, close privatekey_input screen. In vscode terminal, you can close tab

```
screen -ls # Show all screen
screen -x [screenId] # Into screen by id
exit # Quit screen
```
