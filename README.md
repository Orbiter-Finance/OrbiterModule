## Project

- OrbitalModule has been deployed on chain and the code will be made open-source.
- The Docker project is written in js, deployed in the EC2 server, and has no external port.
- It responds to the Senderâ€™s needs via RPC data. It is a tool provided to Navigator.

## Functional

- Running this project requires setting the necessary parameters, such as localProvider and localWSProvider, which support each rollup node.

- By adjusting the parameters, the project can optimize the economic and time savings that users can achieve with Orbiter when configuring the rollup dynamics.

- Once the user initiates payment through the front-end wallet, real-time monitoring of transaction data for each rollup will be enabled, providing timely feedback on the status of the user's cross-rollup transfer.

## Design

**[backend](./backend)** - Navigator's auto script and Dashboard's api services.

**[frontend](./frontend)** - Dashboard's frontend. Based on Vue3 + Element Plus

```

#### Clear shell history

```
# Editor ~/.bash_history, clear shell's privatekey info
vim ~/.bash_history

# Clear cache
history -r
```

####  Set privatekey

Run `privatekey_input.py`
